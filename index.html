        <h1>Hello ! <br></h1>
        <h2>Its me Cristiano Ronaldo.</h2>
        <P>Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his generation. 
          Ronaldo's father, Jos√© Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha.</P>
          <PRE>A tall player
             at 6 feet       1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents
             with a sleight of foot that made   sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.</PRE>
